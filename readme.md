Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of the browser, making it popular for building server-side web applications. Node.js comes with a wide range of built-in modules that allow developers to perform various tasks such as working with the file system, creating HTTP servers, and working with streams. Node.js also has a large and active community, which means there are many third-party modules available for developers to use.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to install Node.js on your machine.

Create a new folder for your Node.js project.

Initialize your project by running the following command in your project folder:

```sh
npm init
```

Install the necessary modules for your project using the following command:

```sh
npm install <module-name>
```

## Code and Notes
