This code uses the `Node.js` built-in `readline` module to create a simple command-line interface that asks the user to solve a random addition problem. The program generates two random numbers, adds them together, and asks the user to enter the correct answer. If the user enters the correct answer, the program prints "Correct Answer!" to the console and exits. If the user enters an incorrect answer, the program prompts the user to try again until they enter the correct answer. The close event is used to close the interface when the user enters the correct answer.
